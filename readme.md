# Fishing Line Experiment

## Summary

This experiment is designed to determine the curvature of the earth solely by mechanical measurement. A neutrally buoyant fishing line `L` should, in theory, form a perfectly straight line when held under high tension in a lengthy stretch of still water. If we setup each end to be a small vertical distance `d` beneath the water surface `S`, and measure the vertical distance `x` of `L`'s centre-point beneath `S`, then:

* `x` > `d` will imply convexity of `S`
* `x` < `d` will imply concavity of `S`
* `x` = `d` will imply flatness of `S`
